            <p class="tab">Attending to the Data Privacy Campaign, learning about cybercrime was helpful and easy to understand. They also have a Q&A session in which both students and teachers can clarify the things they don’t understand and any additional information that may be helpful to other listeners.  They also added a mini raffle for a total of 3 winners at the end of the event which made it more exciting before dismissing.</p>

        <h2>Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A 10173)</h2>
            <p><b>Aims to protect individuals' personal information.</b> It sets guidelines for how organizations or companies handle, process, and secure personal data to ensure the respect of people's privacy. This means that company who will or would store your information as well as use it for other purposes will need to have a direct consent to the user before collecting data information.</p>
        <p>As a CS student, this made me realize the amount of time I’ve shared my personal information with websites or companies that wasn’t approved by National Privacy Commission nor Verified by Google. This teach me to be more careful when inputting personal data or information in any unknown or unverified websites especially those mod downloader websites and even some converter that lets you convert from one type of file to another.  In the Future as a programmer, I need to always consider how I use personal data that I collected and how to secure those data from being stolen or leaked.</p>
        <p>The campaign also talked about <b>Cybercrimes</b> and How to Avoid Falling for it. These cybercrimes include Hacking, Phishing, Malware, Identity Theft, Scams, Cyber harassment, and Data Breaching. These cybercrimes were a major violation of Data Privacy Act and can lead to Imprisonment of 1-3 Years in Unauthorized Processing of Personal Information and 3-6 years in Sensitive Personal Information. Fines for companies range from 500,000 to 2M in Unauthorized Personal Information and 500,00 to 4m if its Sensitive Personal Information.</p>
        <p>This means that people need to be aware not in just in the real world but also in the virtual world or internet, especially when browsing, shopping, booking tickets from unauthorized or unverified sellers. There’s also a safety precautions when dealing with fraudulent emails or messages pretending as your bank, online shopping, and even loans that tries to steal, sell or use your personal information to their own benefit.</p>
        <p>Data Privacy Violation can also be violated by the following; <b>Illegal access to social media websites</b> that may contain personal information, <b>Illegal Interception</b> such as a DDOS attack (Distributed Denial-of Service) in which a user can intercept the flow  of information by sending massive amounts of information in short time causing traffic in the network that may disrupt a server of a website or even crashing out fully which takes time before it can be operated. 
            <b>Data Inteference</b>, a case where a virus or a user deletes, alter, deteriorate or damage a program or data without proper consent. This can result in loss of data, as well as misinformation or overall destruction of computer if the files were sensitive especially if it’s needed for the computer to operate normally. And <b>System Interference</b> , in which a virus or user deletes, alter, deteriorate or damage a program or data relative for the function of the computer, this can result in deletion of the system itself and permanent damage to the system which requires a hard reset or in other words, a total reset. 
            Lastly, <b>Misuse of Devices</b>, which is use, procurement, importation, distribution or making it available for public without the proper rights. This can range from the technological devices that stores information such as (USB, External hard Drive, Cellphones, Tablets, Computers, and Laptops) and sensitive data such as passwords, access code or pin, or any type of information that can be used to grant access to the whole or any part of computer that can used to commit violations under the Data Privacy Act. This can result to access of highly confidential data  or files, and Distribution to other malicious individuals that can result harm to the company or user if not tracked by the appropriate individuals.</p>
        <p>As a summary, <b>Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A 10173)ensures that personal information being entered or transferred by the person was safe and secured in highly guarded or maintained place or server.</b> This ensures that all personal data were kept by the company or website in secret and not leaked or shared to the public. This also ensures that the data given can only be used where it’s necessary and not for other transactions unrelated to the provided use. As a CS Student at UPSHD, It’s safe to say that any personal information I’ve entered both in website and paper were highly secured and is not violating the Data Privacy Act of 2012.</p>
